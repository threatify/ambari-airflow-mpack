    <description> The visibility timeout defines the number of seconds to wait for the worker to acknowledge the task before the message is redelivered to another worker. Make sure to increase the visibility timeout to match the time of the longest ETA you're planning to use. visibility_timeout is only supported for Redis and SQS celery brokers. See: http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/master/userguide/configuration.html#std:setting-broker_transport_options.</description>
